# Bitcoin-BlockChain-Mining-Investing
The repo contains my personal notes and important points regarding Blockchain and Bitcoins in general. The notes are free to use and refer at all time, and will be updated, often. Divided into topics, the notes are to the point, and contain some of my cents here and there. I have tried to cover topics from all the major domains, and answered some of the common questions around. For any feedback, or questions, drop me a message. 


:) Enjoy and Keep Learning
