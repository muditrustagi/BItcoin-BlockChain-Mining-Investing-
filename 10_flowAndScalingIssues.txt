===================================================================================
Bitcoin Flow:

|--- You make a transaction, and many such transactions get clustered together     |	to form a block, which will be added to the blockchain (Thus the name         |    blockchain, Chain of blocks).
|
|--- It is the job of all the miners to add this block to the chain, but before |    that they must verify it, and also bring to required hash form to add.
|
|--- How do they verify? 1mb of data(easy part)
|
|--- PROOF OF WORK? find a 64 bit Hexadecimal suitable hash, for the block. Hence  | 	the machine is measured using the hash it generates every second
|
|--- Difficulty level of hash is adjusted every 2016 blocks to maintain constant   |	mining
|
|--- For adding every block, the miners are awarded. Every block takes around 10 minutes to be done, and for every block ~ 12.5 BTC are shared. Only the first miner is awarded with the money.


Bitcoin and scaling:
|
|--- With more users transacting, the data processed in 10 minute will be less than the data collected in 10 minute and thus transaction times will increase.
|--- so either: 
		|--- decrease the amount of data to verify
		|--- increase the block size


Segregated Witness: remove the signatures from a block, for it to store more transactions.
Bitcoin cash: Another group, increased the block size and called it bitcoin cash
